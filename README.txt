This is the final project for CS 203 - Advanced Visual Basic

This project is to be a to-do list, with 3 main requirements.
1. The user should be able to rank the items, so that things with higher importance can be shown higher on the list. 
2. The user should be able to filter the items based on what kind of task it is - school, work, housework, etc.
3. The user should be able to create a “sublist” of tasks for themselves – select some tasks on the main list, press a button, and bring up a new form with just those tasks listed, so they can have a list just of what they want to accomplish that day without any distractions, and without the tasks necessarily being related by type or importance.
